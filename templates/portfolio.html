            <li>Achievments: In 2006 I had the honor to lead our junior team in the <strong>American Computer Science League</strong> held in Cincinnati, Ohio. They were still teaching Pascal back then but I managed to learn basic <strong>C++</strong> on my own and in 2008 I scored 21st in the <strong>National Olympiad of Computer Sciences</strong>. Other than that, I had the pleasure to build a whole number of the <strong>school magazine</strong>, work on the <strong>school website</strong> and manage the <strong>forum</strong>.<li>
