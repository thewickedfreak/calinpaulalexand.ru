Let me try to clarify a bit more. (For those who are having trouble, reading the synopsis below carefully will lead you to a solution.) There are two independent ways to miss, by ring and by section. One way to implement this idea is to have separate functions to return probability distributions for ring and section outcomes. For example, consider aiming for the S20 target with a miss ratio of 0.2. "If you aim for a thick single ring, it is about 5 times thicker than the thin rings, so your miss ratio is reduced to 1/5th [of your given miss rate; in this case from 0.2 to 0.04], and of these, half go to the double ring and half to the triple", so we have:
>>> ring_outcome('S20', .2)
{'S': 0.96, 'D': 0.02, 'T': 0.02}
For the section outcome, 1/2 the misses go clockwise to the 1 and half counterclockwise to the 5 and we get
>>> section_outcome('S20', .2)
{'1': 0.1, '5': 0.1, '20': 0.8}
These are independent, so combining them we get:
>>> outcome('S20', .2)
{'D20': 0.016, 'S1': 0.096, 'T5': 0.002, 'S5': 0.096, 'T1': 0.002, 
 'S20': 0.768, 'T20': 0.016, 'D5': 0.002, 'D1': 0.002}
Most of the discussion centers (ha ha) on the bulls-eye. According to the definition of ring accuracy for the single bull, "If you aim for the single bull, 1/4 of your misses go to the double bull and 3/4 to the single ring." So that gives us:
>>> ring_outcome('SB', .2)
{'SB': 0.8, 'S': 0.15, 'DB': 0.05}
For the section outcome, a miss goes equally to any of the 20 sections:
>>> section_outcome('SB', .2)
{'B': 0.8, '11': 0.01, '10': 0.01, '13': 0.01, '20': 0.01, '14': 0.01, '17': 0.01, 
 '16': 0.01, '19': 0.01, '18': 0.01, '1': 0.01, '3': 0.01, '2': 0.01, '5': 0.01, 
 '4': 0.01, '7': 0.01, '6': 0.01, '9': 0.01, '15': 0.01, '12': 0.01, '8': 0.01}
First make sure that you can duplicate these results (whether you explicitly have separate ring_outcome and section_outcome function, or whether you have the calculations combined into one function).
For most people, the confusion comes in combining these. Some of the combinations are easy. Again, these are independent, so combining the ring outcome 'SB': 0.8 with the section outcome 'B': 0.8 clearly results in 'SB': 0.64. And combining two misses, like ring outcome 'S': 0.15 with section outcome '11': 0.01 yields 'S11': 0.0015.
But the confusing part, to some people, is what happens when you combine the ring outcome 'S': 0.15 with the section outcome 'B': 0.8? The answer is "If you aim for the bull (single or double) and miss on rings, then the section you end up on is equally possible among all 20 sections. But independent of that you can also miss on sections; again such a miss is equally likely to go to any section and should be recorded as being in the single ring." So this gives you 0.006 for each of 'S1' through 'S20'. So the final total for each of 'S1' through 'S20' is 0.01 + 0.006 = 0.016, and we get this:
>>> outcome('SB', .2)
{'S9': 0.016, 'S8': 0.016, 'S3': 0.016, 'S2': 0.016, 'S1': 0.016, 'DB': 0.04, 
 'S6': 0.016, 'S5': 0.016, 'S4': 0.016, 'S20': 0.016, 'S19': 0.016, 'S18': 0.016, 
 'S13': 0.016, 'S12': 0.016, 'S11': 0.016, 'S10': 0.016, 'S17': 0.016, 'S16': 0.016, 
 'S15': 0.016, 'S14': 0.016, 'S7': 0.016, 'SB': 0.64}
We decided that the grading program will be lenient: because we had some erroneous/confusing statements the first day the exam was out, we will also allow the interpretation that 'S': 0.15 and 'B': 0.8 combine to 'SB'. That would give you:
>>> outcome('SB', .2)
{'S9': 0.01, 'S8': 0.01, 'S3': 0.01, 'S2': 0.01, 'S1': 0.01, 'DB': 0.04, 'S6': 0.01, 
 'S5': 0.01, 'S4': 0.01, 'S19': 0.01, 'S18': 0.01, 'S13': 0.01, 'S12': 0.01, 'S11': 0.01,
 'S10': 0.01, 'S17': 0.01, 'S16': 0.01, 'S15': 0.01, 'S14': 0.01, 'S7': 0.01, 'S20': 0.01,
 'SB': 0.76}
Finally, for those who are interested in learning more, consider this page: http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/darts/ Note that the simplified target model I present in this exercise duplicates some of the findings they come up with, particularly in the path of the optimal target as the miss ratio increases.
I made a mistake in saying: "If you aim for the double bull, it is tiny, so your miss rate [for the ring] is tripled." Obviously that statement makes no sense when the miss ratio is greater than 1/3. You should interpret that as "If you aim for the double bull, it is tiny, so your miss rate [for the ring] is tripled, except that a miss rate can never exceed 1.0, so any input miss rate of 1/3 or higher will have a miss rate of 1 for the bull ring."
